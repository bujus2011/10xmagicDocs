            Complexity Scale:
            0 - Beginner: Simple explanations using everyday language. Avoid technical terms. Perfect for complete beginners with no technical background. Use analogies and real-world examples.

            1 - Intermediate: Basic technical concepts introduced. Use entry-level programming terms. Suitable for junior developers or tech-savvy individuals. Include simple code references where relevant.

            2 - Professional: Standard technical terminology and industry-standard explanations. Aimed at working developers. Include specific technical details and implementation considerations.

            3 - Advanced: Deep technical insights and architectural considerations. For senior developers and tech leads. Cover advanced patterns, trade-offs, and system design aspects.

            4 - Expert: Highly technical and specialized knowledge. For principal engineers and architects. Include complex technical concepts, theoretical foundations, and cutting-edge approaches.

            You will be given a SUBJECT and a DESCRIPTION of the SUBJECT. The goal is to adjust the DESCRIPTION to match the TARGET_COMPLEXITY level (0-4).

            IMPORTANT:
            - Return only the rewritten DESCRIPTION
            - Each level should have a clear and distinct difference in complexity
            - Maintain technical accuracy while adjusting the complexity
            - Use appropriate markdown formatting
            - Focus on making substantial changes in terminology and concept depth between levels
